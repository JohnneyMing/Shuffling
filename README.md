Shuffling
=========
How many times should you shuffle a deck of cards, if you want to be certain that it is actually randomly scrambled? 
I will solve this real-life problem via simulation.


Background info

Standard decks of playing cards contain 52 cards. In order to play a game, one of the players usually attempts to randomize the order of the cards by "shuffling" them. Here are some well known types of shuffles:

"Riffle" shuffle (See: http://www.wikihow.com/Shuffle-a-Deck-of-Cards-(Riffle-Bridge) or video at http://youtu.be/o-KBNdbJOGk )
"Overhand" shuffle (See: http://youtu.be/N2xlgAFWBZM)
"Faro" or "Pharaoh" shuffle (See: http://youtu.be/ch_SMNQ-awM)
"Hindu" shuffle (See: http://youtu.be/LgVFb1U_fco)
Ideally, we would like the cards to be randomly shuffled, independently of where they started. So even if a card (say the Ace of Spades) is on top of the deck when you start, it is equally likely to be in any of the 52 possible positions at the end of the shuffle. In other words, we want the positions of the cards in the deck to be uniformly randomly distributed by the shuffle.
